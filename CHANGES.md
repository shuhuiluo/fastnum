## [0.1.10] – 2025-02-04

This release primarily focuses on:

- Implementing a full range of advanced mathematical functions (exponential, roots, power, logarithmic, and
  trigonometric functions) for working with exact precision decimal numbers.
- Increasing the accuracy of approximated mathematical calculations due to the use of extra precision digits and the
  absence of intermediate rounding.
- Fixing and improving conversions between Float and Decimal types.

Expect better performance, precision handling, and expanded documentation covering new methods, constants, and examples.
Highlights include removing `libm` dependency and major refinements for `no-std` environments.

### Added

- Implement exponential `exp` and binary exponential `exp2` functions for decimals.
- Implement logarithmic `ln`, `log10`, `log2`, `log` functions for decimals.
- Implement `sqrt`, `cbrt`, and `nth_root` roots functions for decimals.
- Refactor and extend `pow` to support non-integer exponents.
- Implement base trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sin_cos` for decimals.
- Implement inverse trigonometric functions: `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2` for decimals.
- Implement hyperbolic functions: `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh` for decimals.
- Implement inverse hyperbolic functions: `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh` for decimals.
- Implement hypotenuse calculation `hypot` function for decimals.
- Introduce fused multiply-add `mul_add` operation without intermediate rounding.
- Introduce `transmute` operation for N-to-M bit decimal conversion.
- Add integer and unsigned integer conversion utilities (`from_int`, `from_uint`).
- Implement `num_traits::float::Float` trait.

### Changed

- Improved arithmetic precision of approximated mathematical calculations due to the use of extra precision digits and
  the absence of intermediate rounding.
- Overhauled mathematical constants. Add `INEXACT` flag and extra precision digits.
- Mark some methods as `inexact` by design.
- Micro-optimizations in rounding.
- Inline optimizations and better precision handling for mathematical rounding.
- Re-implement `recip` method without division.
- Improve test coverage for mathematical operations (e.g., `sqrt`, `ln`, `exp`).
- Remove `libm` dependency for `no-std` environment.

### Fixed

- Corrected edge cases for float (`f32`/`f64`) from/to `Decimal` conversions (
  fix [#5](https://github.com/neogenie/fastnum/issues/5#issue-2813957559)).
- Fix _long_ rounding issues with improved context precision.
- General code quality improvements and bug fixes, including better inexact flag handling.

### Documentation

- Expanded documentation for all major operations with examples.
- Added comprehensive examples and descriptions to `LIB.md`.
- Minor fixes.
