# Changelog

All user-visible changes to this library will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), as described
for Rust libraries in [RFC #1105](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1105-api-evolution.md)

# [0.7.0] - 2025-08-21

### Added
- Big-integer conversion APIs:
  - Parsing from raw bytes:
    - `from_radix_be(buf, radix) -> Option<Self>`
    - `from_radix_le(buf, radix) -> Option<Self>`

  - Encoding to raw bytes:
    - `to_radix_be(radix) -> Vec<u8>`
    - `to_radix_le(radix) -> Vec<u8>`

  - String conversion helpers:
    - `parse_str_radix(s, radix) -> Self` (panicking variant)
    - `parse_bytes(buf, radix) -> Option<Self>`
    - `to_str_radix(radix) -> String`

### Documentation
- Conversion documentation expanded with clearer semantics, base handling, and examples.
- Improved doc comments for:
  - Base-aware parsing behavior and panic conditions.
  - Byte-level import/export helpers.
  - `parse_str(s)` and `from_str(s)` for big integers recognize `0x` and `0b` prefixes (decimal remains default without a prefix).

### Internal
- Conversion code reorganized into focused modules:
  - `bint/convert/{from_bytes,to_bytes,from_str,to_str}.rs`
- Macro routing for conversion implementation is simplified and de-duplicated.

# [0.6.2] - 2025-08-18

### Changed

- Minor internal performance improvements.

# [0.6.1] - 2025-08-16

### Changed

- Minor performance improvements.

# [0.6.0] - 2025-08-16

### Breaking changes

- Removed previously deprecated Decimal methods:
    - `from_scale` (use `quantum` instead).
    - `normalized` (use `reduce` instead).
    - `with_scale` (use `rescale` instead).

### Added

- Decimal truncation API ([#39](https://github.com/neogenie/fastnum/issues/39)):
    - `Decimal::trunc()` — truncates to integral with no fractional portion without rounding.
    - `Decimal::trunc_with_scale(scale)` — truncates to the specified scale without rounding.

### Changed

- Internal documentation macro routing for decimal type aliases refined (no public API impact).

### Documentation

- Minor fixes.
- Added a dedicated “Truncate” section with behavior details and examples.

### Internal

- Introduced an internal truncation implementation integrated with scaling and extra-precision handling to ensure true
  truncation semantics (no rounding).

# [0.5.0] - 2025-08-15

### Added

- Type conversion traits for integers and decimals:
    - `Cast` — type-safe, infallible conversion (e.g., widening or lossless transforms).
    - `TryCast` — checked conversion returning an error on overflow, sign mismatch, or incompatible scale.
    - Supported families: unsigned/signed big integers (`U64`, `U128`, `U256`, `U512`, `U1024`, and `I64`, `I128`,
      `I256`, `I512`, `I1024`) [#42](https://github.com/neogenie/fastnum/issues/42) and decimals (`UD64`, `UD128`,
      `UD256`, `UD512`, `UD1024`, and `D64`, `D128`, `D256`,
      `D512`, `D1024`).
    - Common scenarios:
        - Widening cast for integers — via `Cast`.
        - Checked narrowing cast — via `TryCast`, with overflow errors.
        - Conversions between unsigned and signed integers — `TryCast` rejects negative/out-of-range values.
        - Conversions between `UD*` and `D*` — proper sign/scale propagation with checks in `TryCast`.
- Const-generic “dimensions” for conversion direction checks:
    - Internal `Widen`/`Narrow` markers ensure `Cast`/`TryCast` correctness without unstable generic const expressions.

### Deprecated

- Decimal `.transmute()` is now deprecated (since "0.5.0"); removal is planned for a future major release.
  Use `.resize()` or cast via `Cast` and `TryCast` traits instead.
